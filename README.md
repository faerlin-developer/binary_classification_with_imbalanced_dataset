# Binary Classification with Imbalanced Dataset

This is my final project for Brainstation's Machine Learning Certificate Course (https://brainstation.io/course/toronto/machine-learning). 

## Abstract

In classification, when the number of examples that represent one class is much lower than other classes, the dataset is said to be imbalanced. This problem is one of the challenging problems both in data mining research and real-world application (Yang, 2005). In this project, our aim is to gain experience working with a dataset that suffers from this problem. We take the Intel Image dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) and construct an imbalance dataset suitable for a binary classification task (see preprocessing steps). We build various classifiers including linear, nonlinear, ensemble methods, and neural networks to model this dataset. To compare the performance of these classifiers, we plot their ROC curves and compute their AUCs.
